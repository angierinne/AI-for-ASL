The project also lets users to learn about American Sign Language (ASL), a language that allows people to communicate through hand signals.

            <div class="mt-6 text-lg mx-[20%]"> We wanted a simple application that sparks curiosity and understanding of AI and machine learning (ML). In AI for ASL, the user signs ASL characters into a camera and the application attempts to accurately interpret the hand signs.

        <div class="mt-6 text-lg mx-[20%]">We created two models, <i>Blue </i>and <i>Red</i>, that are each trained to recognize five characters. The Blue model was trained to recognize the characters <b>a, b, c, d,</b> and <b>l</b>. The Red model was trained to recognize <strong>d, e, f, g, </strong>and <strong>i</strong>. By having two models, we introduce the idea that AI needs to be specifically trained to complete certain tasks. The Blue model cannot recognize all characters in the Red model, and vice versa.
